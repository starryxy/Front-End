# PRG (Post-Redirect-Get) pattern is a very common design pattern for interactive
# HTTP applications and APIs. A client POSTs to a server to create or update a resource;
# on success, the server replies with a 303 redirect instead of a 200 OK.
# The redirect causes the client to GET the created or updated resource.
#
# For the messageboard server, Post-Redirect-Get means:
#
# 1. You go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.
#     Your browser sends a GET request to the server, which replies with a 200 OK and a piece of HTML.
#     You see a form for posting comments, and a list of the existing comments.
#     (But at the beginning, there are no comments posted yet.)
# 2. You write a comment in the form and submit it.
#     Your browser sends it via POST to the server.
# 3. The server updates the list of comments, adding your comment to the list.
#     Then it replies with a 303 redirect, setting the Location: / header to tell the browser to request the main page via GET.
# 4. The redirect response causes your browser to go back to the same page you started with, sending a GET request, which replies with a 200 OK and a piece of HTML.
#
# One big advantage of Post-Redirect-Get is that as a user, every page you actually see
# is the result of a GET request, which means you can bookmark it, reload it, etc.
# â€” without ever accidentally resubmitting a form.
#
#
# Step three in building the messageboard server. Run the test3.py script to check it.
