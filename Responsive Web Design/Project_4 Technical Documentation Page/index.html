    <header>Introduction</header>
    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
      <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
    <header>Hello World</header>
    <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
    <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }<br>greetMe("World");</code>
    <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="constants">
    <header>Constants</header>
    <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
    <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
    <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
    <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
    <p></p>
    <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; <br>// THIS WILL
CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; <br>//statements
}</code>
    <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
    <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
    <header>Data Types</header>
    <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>and Object</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
    <header>if...else statement</header>
    <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
    <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
    <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
    <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
    <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } <br>else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
} <br>else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } <br>else { statement_last; }</code>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
    <header>while statement</header>
    <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
    <code>while (condition) statement</code>
    <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.</p>
